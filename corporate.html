                  #EE7622
                  <em>This color is one of our two main colors, we chose this color because of the dark undertone which makes it a very good color to get contrast with. It is very readable and is easy to combine with almost any other color (masculine color).</em>

                <li>

                  #00406B
                  <em>This color is the other main color, we chose this color because of the warm and inviting look, it feels very welcoming and that suits our brand very well. It is also in very nice contrast with the dark blue, making it a good attention grabbing combination (feminine color).</em>

                  #EE7622
                  <em>This color is one of the accent colors we chose. This cool toned greyish blue stands out from the rest of our color pallete making it the perfect pop of color to use for accents. </em>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mr evans san ot bold:</strong>
            	This font is easy to read and we chose bold so we could use this for important parts that must stand out<br>

				        <strong>Mr evans san ot reg:</strong>
				        This font is the regular version of our highlight/title font. We chose this one for body text so it will look very clean and coordinated.
			       </li>
            <li> We have an carrousel at the main page in order for people to get a feel of what we are about. The carroussel shows people dating. our navigation bar has round ends because we want to feel soft and pure instead of harsh. For the buttons we wanted to have a clear indication that they could klik on it.

          <ul>
            <li>We want to make our website to be easy accesible and also give the attention towards donating. Making it also easy for them to donate</li>
            <li>Our testing <strong>methods</strong>, </li>
                <li>We have conducted 3 testings with participants that are in the age of 25 and 35, which matches our target audience. </li>
                <li>The testing took place in front of an laptop in Lars his house. </li>
                <li>The testing has been filmed and is in the folder "Testing" in the one-drive (see appendix). during the testing we asked some questions regarding the website. First we wanted them to navigate towards the product information. As second, we wanted them to donate 50 euros. After that we asked them to donate 50 euros but at checkout change their mind and donate 100 euros. At last we wanted them to navigate towads the testimonials.</li>
              </ul>
            
              <ul>
                <li>Our testing <strong>results</strong>, </li>
                <li>We have seen that it was easy to identify where more information about the product was stated. Also donating was easy to navigate to. Testimonials were harder to find but everyone could find them. Except for our last contender that couldnt find it because they didn't know the english word "testimonial" stood for reviews. We discovered a problem when it came to changing the donation amount from 50 euro's to something else. There was no clear way to change that.</li>
                <li>We want to implement a button to change the amount of money you want to donate at the check out page. This would solve the problem that we encountered. As far of the testimonial problem we would solve that with more languages on the website but this is too hard to implement.</li>
              </ul>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>At Purely we value, memorable experiences, ease of use, not settling for the norm, and genuine connections. We want to provide parents with young children with additional time to spend with loved ones in an easy and fun way. Therefore, we created our communication message: “less time worrying, more time enjoying”. Implying that our target audience does not have to worry about scheduling and planning a fun activity, all the time and energy they have left as a busy parent can be spent enjoying their date.</p>
          <p>We have based our promotional activities on the preference of our target audience. During the problem interviews, most of our interviewees from our target group responded they use Instagram and Facebook most often. With this in mind, we created our objectives and tried to implement our discoveries from the interviews in our promotional activities when creating the content planning, which is visible in our Communication & Media Plan. With our social media campaign, we wanted to raise brand awareness and for people to visit our website. Therefore, we aimed to make our objectives in the Communication & Media Plan as realistic as possible. </p>
          <p>First, we tried to reach our reach objective, which is visible in our Communication & Media Plan, by posting three times a week in the evenings. We have learned from our interviews that our target audience is too busy during the day to scroll through Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, we choose to post at six o’clock in the evening because this would be around the time, we’d have the highest chance of them viewing our social media posts. </p>
          <p> In addition, our first two posts contain our communication message: “less time worrying, more time enjoying”. We choose to spread our communication message already in the first two posts because the more our target audience sees our message, the more likely they are to understand that additional time can be provided by our service to connect with loved their loved ones. </p>
          <p> To reach our response objective, we used the following hashtags to try to attract followers and stimulate views: #parentlife #purely #lovedones #freetime #datenight #nomoreworries #community. These hashtags were used in all captions of all posts on Instagram and Facebook. </p>
          <p> These are our social media accounts, and the links to the social media accounts. </p>

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>We have learned that our objectives could have been realistic, however, we should have done more to promote our social media accounts to reach our objectives. Moreover, since we have not posted consistently on Facebook, we will only discuss our Instagram insights. </p>
          <p>To begin, we wanted that our social media posts were viewed by 200 people by Friday the 7th of April. However, these ended up being 48 accounts.</p>
          <img alt="reach objective" class="img-thumbnail" src="images/reachobjective.jpg">
          <p> Moreover, we wanted 60 parents of young children to understand our message that additional time can be provided by our service to connect with loved their loved ones. Therefore, we aimed to have 60 likes in total for all our posts by Friday, April 7th. Unfortunately, these turned out to be 40 likes in total for all our posts.</p>

            <p>Lastly, we wanted at least 20 people to follow our Facebook page and Instagram account, and click on our website link. Luckily, 24 people ended up following our Instagram page, but only 3 people followed our Facebook page. </p>
            <p>With most of our objectives left unreached, we have learned there are several things we could have done better in the execution of our social media campaign. </p>
            <p><strong>1) Post sooner</strong><br>
              First of all, we believe that if we had started posting content in week 11, after the feedback we received during our pitch, we could have had more time to attract followers and come up with more diverse content, for example, making more reels, since reels have proven to be more effective when wanting to attract new followers and more views. </p>
            <p><strong>2) Sticking to the planner</strong><br>
              Secondly, not every one of our team had posted on our Facebook page, but mainly on Instagram. We believe this could be one of the reasons why our Facebook page has fewer followers than our Instagram page. Moreover, this implies we have learned that we should have kept better track of each other’s actions, and posts to see if everyone was posting according to the content planner. </p>
            <p><strong>3) Following others helps to create brand awareness</strong><br>
                Third, we believe we could have reached our reach objective if we started following the brands our target audience liked, and the people from our target audience. After week 12, we did not gain new followers. Therefore, we have learned a first impression of a social media account is crucial. Moreover, we did not follow other accounts back. We believe if we did do this, we could have gained new followers if we followed others as well. 
            <p><strong>4)  Creating posts that attract followers is crucial </strong><br>
                If we had done more distinct research about our target audience's media preferences and about what kind of social media posts reached more people before we actually started posting, our objectives could have been reached. </p>
            <p><strong>5) First Impression</strong><br>
                All of our followers started following us in the first few days we created our Instagram and Facebook accounts. Therefore, we learned that a first impression of a social media account is crucial to building followership.</p> 






          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>As mentioned at the learning points, we believe we could have improved our social media campaign, and we could have reached our objectives if we had posted sooner, stuck better to our planning, followed others, created posts that attract followers, and think thoroughly about the first impression of our social media page. In addition to this, we believe there are several things we could do in the future if this project were to continue.</p>
          <p><strong>1) Rule of 7</strong><br>
              To begin, we should have worked according to the ‘rule of 7’. We did implement our communication message in two of our social media posts, however, we could have repeated it in all our posts, even if it was in the caption. Therefore, if we would have kept on doing this in future planning, we could have reached our response objective, and people eventually might have clicked on our website link and bought a subscription. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>2) Expand ToFU Stage</strong><br>
              The second thing we could do in the future is to expand the ToFu stage we were in. We tried to make our target audience aware of our brand by posting our values, mission, and communication message, on social media. However, if the project were to continue, we could make more diverse content and not just post on social media, but we could for example make and share more detailed infographics about how our service works, and share these on our social media platforms. To add, we could collaborate with magazines and podcasts that attract the same target audience and have them mention our brand. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>3)  Instagram Reels</strong><br>
              Lastly, we have noticed our Instagram reel has reached more accounts and is viewed more often than the other posts on our social media. Therefore, in future planning, we would make more reels to attract new followers and expand brand awareness. </p>

          <img src="images/finalleancanvas.png" class="img-fluid" alt="final lean canvas">

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>Based on our problem and solution interviews, we validated that our initial assumptions were not entirely accurate. Through customer interviews, we found that our initial focus on organizing events for parents and their children was not as attractive as a subscription-based service that centres on creating meaningful experiences for parents only. Our decision to pivot towards offering babysitting services as an optional add-on for an extra price was validated by customer demand for more flexibility and convenience. As some of the parents we interviewed already had a reliable person in charge of taking care of the kids when they are busy, or they could not trust anyone else other than family to take care of the kid, we opted for an additional fee for the babysitter rather than a fixed price that all subscribers need to pay. We also validated the need to use existing social media platforms for our community instead of creating our own community platform, as our target audience already uses an existing social media platform to connect with other parents. An additional platform would've proved confusing and unnecessary for our concept. Based on feedback received during our interview, we are considering pivoting our revenue stream from a subscription model to a 20-date package or a one-time purchase for a single date. Our interviewees expressed interest in having more flexibility in their dating schedule, rather than being "forced" to go on a date once a month with a subscription plan. With the 20-date package, customers can use their dates anytime within a 6-month availability period, giving them the freedom to plan their dates at their own pace. The one-time purchase option would also provide customers with the flexibility to plan their dates around their schedules without the added commitment of a subscription plan. We will continue to explore these options and gather further feedback to ensure we are providing our customers with the best experience possible. The price for our current package is too low as well. Considering we are offering a free drink for our 10-euro subscription, each one of the partners would buy a cocktail and the subscription price would be surpassed. Based on our interviews, we are considering raising the price of our service around the 30–50-euro range, adding the planning of an uber ride from their home to the location and vice-versa. Another pivot we might make in the future, is the way we charge for the babysitter. Considering babysitters are paid an hourly wage, the customer should choose the amount of time is one is needed, based on the date. A restaurant date might take up 5 hours, meanwhile a full day event can require a babysitter for up to 8 hours.</p>
