          <ul>
            <li>
              A colour scheme (with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website)
              <em>&mdash; see the example below from the BUas brand book:</em>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">

                  #EE7622
                  <em>This color is one of our two main colors, we chose this color cause of the dark undertone wich makes it a very good color to get contrast with. It is very readable and is easy to combine with almost any other color.  ( masculine color)</em>

                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #D99D8F;"></span>
                  #00406B
                  <em>This color is the other main color, we chose tis color because of the warm and inviting look, it feels very welcoming and that suits our brand very well. It is also in very nice contrast with the dark blue making it a good attention grabbing combination. ( feminine color)</em>

                  #EE7622
                  <em>This color is one of the accent colors we chose, this cool toned greyish blue stands out from the rest of our color pallete making it the perfect pop of color to use for accents. </em>

                  <em>:This color is one of the accent colors, we chose this color because of the readabillity combined with the rest of our color pallete. It is a good highlighting color and easy to combine with the rest of our pallete.</em>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Mr evans san ot bold:</strong>
            	this font is easy to read and we chose bold so we could use this for important parts that need to stand out<br>

				<strong>Mr evans san ot reg:</strong>
				 this font is the regular version of our highlight/ title font, we chose this one for body text so it will look very clean and coordinated.
			</li>
            <li> We have an carrousel at the main page in order for people to get a feel of what we are about. The carroussel shows people dating. our navigation bar has round ends because we want to feel soft and pure instead of harsh. For the buttons we wanted to have a clear indication that they could klik on it.

          <ul>
            <li>We want to make our website to be easy accesible and also give the attention towards donating. Making it also easy for them to donate</li>
            <li>Your testing <strong>methods</strong>, which includes information about:
              <ul>
                <li>WE have conducted 3 testings with participants that are in the age of 25 and 35, which matches our target audience.
                <li>The testing took place in front of an laptop in Lars his house.
                <li>The testing has been filmed and is in the folder "Testing" in the one-drive (see appendix). during the testing we asked some questions regarding the website. First we wanted them to navigate towards the product information. As second, we wanted them to donate 50 euros. After that we asked them to donate 50 euros but at checkout change their mind and donate 100 euros. At last we wanted them to navigate towads the testimonials.
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your testing <strong>results</strong>, which includes information about:
              <ul>
                <li>We have seen that it was easy to identify where more information about the product was stated. Also donating was easy to navigate to. Testimonials were harder to find but everyone could find them. Except for our last contender that couldnt find it because they didn't know the english word "testimonial" stood for reviews. We discovered a problem when it came to changing the donation amount from 50 euro's to something else. There was no clear way to change that.</li>
                <li>We want to implement a button to change the amount of money you want to donate at the check out page. This would solve the problem that we encountered. As far of the testimonial problem we would solve that with more languages on the website but this is too hard to implement.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>Based on our problem and solution interviews, we validated that our initial assumptions were not entirely accurate. Through problem interviews, we found that our initial focus on organizing events for parents and their children was not as attractive as a subscription-based service that enters on creating meaningful experiences for parents only. 

		  Our decision to pivot towards offering babysitting services as an optional add-on for an extra price was validated by customer demand for more flexibility and convenience. As some of the parents we interviewed already had a reliable person in charge of taking care of the kids when they are busy, or they could not trust anyone else other than family to take care of the kid, we opted for an additional fee for the babysitter rather than a fixed price that all subscribers need to pay. 

		  We also validated the need to use existing social media platforms for our community instead of creating our own community platform, as our target audience already uses an existing social media platform to connect with other parents. An additional platform would've proved confusing and unnecessary for our concept.</p>
